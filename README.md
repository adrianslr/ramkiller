# RamKiller

RamKiller is a simple script that kills and logs when an app has high RAM usage.
Used this in the past for a game server, and thinked it may be useful for someone else.
  - You can put the maximum RAM usage permitted in the script
  - You can put the name of the app that you want to control in the script
  - By the default, the log file is: /home/ramkiller.log

# Known bugs
  - Sometimes, the owner of the killed process is not the real one
